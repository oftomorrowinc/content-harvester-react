# Content Harvester React - Project Kickoff

## Project Vision

Transform the successful Node.js Content Harvester application into a modern React TypeScript component library, creating a reusable NPM package that developers can easily integrate into Next.js and React applications while maintaining the intuitive dark-themed user experience.

## Background

The original Content Harvester was built as a Node.js/Express application with Pug templates and HTMX for interactivity. While functional and well-designed, it was limited to server-side rendering and lacked the flexibility needed for modern React ecosystems. This project reimagines Content Harvester as a component library that brings the same powerful content collection capabilities to the React world.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Component Library**: Create a production-ready NPM package for React applications
2. **Type Safety**: Implement comprehensive TypeScript support with strict configuration
3. **Developer Experience**: Provide excellent DX with hot reloading, testing, and documentation
4. **Design Consistency**: Maintain the dark GitHub-inspired theme and user experience
5. **Firebase Integration**: Modernize backend integration with Firebase v9 modular SDK

### Success Metrics
- **Usability**: Drop-in component that works in 5 minutes or less
- **Performance**: Sub-second initial load and smooth interactions
- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage and comprehensive TypeScript types
- **Adoption**: Ready for production use with complete documentation

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**:
- React 18+ with hooks and concurrent features
- TypeScript 5+ with strict mode configuration

```

## User Experience Design

### Core User Flows

1. **URL Collection**
   ```
   User pastes text → Extract URLs → Validate → Add to table → Real-time sync
   ```

2. **File Upload**
   ```
   User drags files → Validate types → Upload to Storage → Update Firestore → Table refresh
   ```

3. **Content Management**
   ```
   View table → Sort/filter → Toggle settings → Delete items → Process all
   ```

### Interface Design Principles

- **Dark Theme Only**: Consistent GitHub-inspired dark color palette
- **Table-Centric**: Content displayed in sortable, filterable table format
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed
- **Immediate Feedback**: Toast notifications and real-time status updates
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Visual Design System

```css
/* Color Palette */
Background Primary:   #0d1117  /* Main app background */
Background Secondary: #161b22  /* Card/panel backgrounds */
Background Tertiary:  #1c2129  /* Input/button backgrounds */
Border Primary:       #30363d  /* Default borders */
Text Primary:         #c9d1d9  /* Main text color */
Text Secondary:       #8b949e  /* Secondary text */
Accent Primary:       #7e43ff  /* Primary actions/links */
Status Colors:        Semantic colors for pending/processing/completed/error
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Component Library Approach
**Decision**: Build as a component library rather than a complete application
**Reasoning**: Maximum flexibility for different use cases and design systems
**Trade-offs**: More complex setup but much more versatile

### 2. Firebase Client SDK
**Decision**: Use Firebase v9 modular SDK on the client side
**Reasoning**: Smaller bundle size, better tree-shaking, modern architecture
**Trade-offs**: Users must provide Firebase config, but more flexible deployment

### 3. Dark Theme Only
**Decision**: Support only dark theme to match original design
**Reasoning**: Simpler implementation, consistent brand, most developer preference
**Trade-offs**: Less flexibility but better focus and implementation quality

### 4. TypeScript-First
**Decision**: Build with TypeScript from the ground up
**Reasoning**: Better developer experience, fewer runtime errors, self-documenting
**Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex setup but much better long-term maintainability

### 5. Tailwind CSS
**Decision**: Use Tailwind for styling instead of CSS-in-JS
**Reasoning**: Better performance, smaller bundle, utility-first approach
**Trade-offs**: Additional build step but better optimization and developer experience

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
